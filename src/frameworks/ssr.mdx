# Integration of React Components with Server Side Rendering
This guide walks you through setting up Syncfusion React components with server-side rendering (SSR) using `Express.js`.

## What is SSR?

Server-Side Rendering (SSR) is a technique where a React application is rendered on the server instead of in the browser, allowing the server to generate and send fully rendered `HTML` to the client. This results in a faster initial page load, as users see meaningful content immediately without waiting for `JavaScript` to execute. It also improves SEO, since search engines can crawl the complete HTML content, enhances user experience on slower networks by reducing perceived loading time.

SSR works by processing the React components on the server using tools like `ReactDOMServer`, generating HTML, and sending it to the browser, where React then hydrates the content to make it interactive.

## Set up the React project

To get started with `SSR` and Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components, set up a basic React application using Create React App.

<Snippet content={ssrReactSetUP}/>

## Add Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React packages

To use Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components in the project, install the corresponding npm package. This guide uses the React <Link to="/floating-action-button">`FAB`</Link> component as an example. To use the React `FAB` component in the project, the `@syncfusion/react-buttons` package needs to be installed using the following command:

<Snippet content={fabBtnPackage} />

### Install SSR dependencies

For server-side rendering functionality with `Express`, install additional packages. Run the following command to install all the required dependencies:

<Snippet content={ssrAdditionals}/>

## Configure server

* First, create a `server` directory and create a file called `root.js` into it, which will be the entry point for the SSR process:

<Snippet content={ssrServerRoot}/>

* The server component handles rendering the React application on the server and sending it to the client. Here's how to configure it:

<Snippet content={ssrServer}/>

## Configure client

The client-side React application needs to be structured to work correctly with SSR:

* Now, let's update the client entry point file `src/index.js`. This file will hydrate the React application on the client side after the initial server-side render:

<Snippet content={ssrIndex}/>

* Update `src/App.js` file that will contains Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React component. This component will be rendered both on the server and client sides:

<Snippet content={ssrApp}/>

## Run the project

Before running the project, update the `package.json` to include the server script for running the SSR implementation.

1. Add the following script to the `package.json` file:

<Snippet content={ssrJson}/>

2. First, build the production version of the React application:

<Snippet content={ssrBuild}/>

3. After building the application, start the `Express` server that handles SSR:

<Snippet content={ssrServe}/>

The output will appear as follows:

<Preview content={<FloatingActionButton />} header={false} />
