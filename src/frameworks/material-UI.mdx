# Integration of Material-UI Components

<a href="https://mui.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Material-UI</a> is a popular library for building user interfaces in React applications. It offers a comprehensive set of pre-designed, customizable UI components based on Material Design principles. These components include buttons, forms, navigation bars, modals, cards, and more, making it easy to create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces.

The Syncfusion<sup>速</sup> `Material 3` theme is designed to follow the Material-UI guidelines, ensuring a consistent appearance with `Material-UI` components. This makes it seamless to integrate Syncfusion<sup>速</sup> React components with existing Material-UI components, allowing you to create a unified and visually appealing application.

This guide will provide you with a step-by-step process for integrating `Material-UI` component into the Syncfusion<sup>速</sup> React `Message` component.

## Set up the React project

1\. Set up a new React project by referring to the Syncfusion<sup>速</sup> React `Message` component's <Link to="/message#getting-started">Getting Started</Link> documentation.

2\. Install the necessary `Material-UI` dependencies using the command:

<Snippet content={[ { title: "CMD", code: 'npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled --save' }]} />

## Integrate Material-UI components

Integrate `Material-UI` components with the React `Message` component by directly including them as children. You can structure the Material-UI components inside a custom function and render the output within the `Message` component, as shown in the code snippet below:

<Snippet content={muiSnippets} />

## Run the project

Execute the following command to run the project:

<Snippet content={[ { title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' } ]} />

The output will appear as follows:

<Preview content={<MaterialUI />} header={false} />
