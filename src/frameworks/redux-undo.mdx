# Integration of React Components with Redux Undo

This guide demonstrates how to integrate Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components with a `Redux Undo`.

## What is Redux Undo?

<a href="https://github.com/omnidan/redux-undo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redux Undo</a> is a higher-order reducer for Redux, designed to add `undo/redo` functionality to your application's state management. It works by wrapping your existing reducer and managing a history of past, present, and future states allowing users to `undo` or `redo` changes to the application state with ease.

## Set up the React project

1\. Create a new React project using <Link to="/getting-started/vite#create-a-vite-project">Vite</Link>.

2\. Install the necessary `Redux` dependencies by running the following command:

<Snippet content={[ { title: "CMD", code: 'npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux redux-undo --save' }]} />

## Configure the Redux slice

Setting up a Redux slice means creating a specific section of your application’s state, along with the actions and reducers that can modify this state. 

By wrapping your Redux slice reducer with the `undoable` function from `redux-undo`, you can add built-in `undo` and `redo` capabilities to your state. Create a new file named `textboxSlice.tsx` and add the following code snippet.

<Snippet content={reduxUndoSlice} />

## Set Up the Redux store

After creating the Redux slice, you need to set up the `Redux store` to combine your reducers and manage your application's state.

Create a new file named `store.tsx` and add the following code:

<Snippet content={reduxUndoStore} />

## Integrate the Redux store with React

To make the `Redux store` available throughout your React application, you need to wrap your main App component with the `Provider` from `react-redux` in `main.tsx` file. This allows any nested component to access the Redux store state and dispatch actions.

<Snippet content={reduxUndoMain} />

## Add Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components

To add Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React `Textbox` component to your application, follow these steps:

1\. Install the necessary dependencies for React components.

<Snippet content={[ { title: "CMD", code: 'npm install @syncfusion/react-inputs --save' }]} />

2\. Add the `TextBox` component to the application

<Snippet content={reduxUndoTextbox} />

## Connect the TextBox component to Redux Undo

This section shows how to connect the `TextBox` component to your `Redux store` with `undo` and `redo` support. When you connect the `TextBox` component to your Redux store using `redux-undo`, the values entered in the `TextBox` can be easily undone and redone.

## Run the project

Execute the following command to run the project:

<Snippet content={[ { title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' } ]} />

The output will appear as follows:
