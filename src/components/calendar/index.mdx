# React Calendar

The React `Calendar` component provides an intuitive interface for date selection and navigation. It offers a comprehensive set of features including multiple view modes, date range restrictions, custom rendering, and accessibility support for building robust date-picking experiences.

## Getting started

To create a new Vite project, refer to the <Link to="/getting-started/vite?section=set-up-the-vite-project">Vite</Link> documentation. Once that Vite project is ready to run with default settings, let's add the React `Calendar` component to the project.

### Installing SyncfusionÂ® packages

To use the React `Calendar` component in this project, the [`@syncfusion/react-calendars`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/react-calendars) package needs to be installed using the following command:

<Snippet content={calendarNpm}/>

### Adding CSS reference

In this article, the `Material 3` theme is applied using CSS styles, which are available in installed packages. The necessary Material CSS styles for the `Calendar` component and its dependents were imported into the **src/App.css** file.

<Snippet content={calendarStyles}/>

### Adding Calendar component

To include the `Calendar` component in your application, import the `Calendar` from the `@syncfusion/react-calendars` package in **App.tsx**.

<Snippet content={calendarImport} />

Add the `Calendar` component in application as shown in below code example.

<Snippet content={calendarSnippet} />

### Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' }]} />

The `Calendar` component provides a simple and intuitive way to select dates. By default, it displays the current month and allows users to navigate between months and years.

<Preview 
  content={<BasicCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/basic-usage.tsx"
/>

## Views

The `Calendar` component supports multiple view modes including month, year, and decade views. Users can switch between different views using the `start` and `depth` properties to control the initial view and navigation depth.

<Preview 
  content={<CalendarViews />} 
  path="calendar/views.tsx"
/>

## Select View

The `Calendar` component supports multiple view modes including month, year, and decade views. Users can switch between different views using the radio buttons to control the initial view.

<Preview 
  content={<MultipleView />} 
  path="calendar/multiple-view.tsx"
/>

## Date Range

The `minDate` and `maxDate` properties used to control date selection by setting minimum and maximum selectable dates. This ensures users can only select dates within the specified range, making it ideal for booking systems and date-restricted scenarios.

<Preview 
  content={<DateRangeCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/date-range.tsx"
/>

## Controlled Vs Uncontrolled

The `Calendar` component supports both controlled and uncontrolled modes. In controlled mode, the `value` prop manages the selected date externally, while uncontrolled mode uses the `defaultValue` prop for initial state with internal state management.

<Preview 
  content={<ControlledCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/controlled-vs-uncontrolled.tsx"
/>

## Disabled Dates

The `cellTemplate` property is used to customize the appearance of specific dates, allowing to disable those dates to prevent user selection. This is useful for blocking weekends, holidays, or unavailable dates in scheduling applications.

<Preview 
  content={<DisabledDatesCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/disabled-dates.tsx"
/>

## Special Dates

The `cellTemplate` property is used to customize the appearance of specific dates by highlighting important dates, events, or special occasions with custom styling, icons, or indicators.
 
<Preview 
  content={<SpecialDatesCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/special-dates.tsx"
/>

## Month Picker
 
Configure the calendar to function as a month picker by setting the appropriate `start` and `depth` properties. This mode allows users to select entire months rather than specific dates, perfect for monthly reports or billing cycles.
 
<Preview 
  content={<MonthPickerCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/month-picker.tsx"
/>

## Week Numbers

The `weekNumber` property is used to display week numbers alongside the calendar dates. This feature is particularly useful for business applications that reference ISO week numbers for planning and reporting purposes.
 
<Preview 
  content={<WeekNumbersCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/week-numbers.tsx"
/>

## Week Days Format

The `WeekDaysFormat` property is used to display week days into a different formats alongside the calendar dates.
 
<Preview 
  content={<WeekDaysCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/weekdays-format.tsx"
/>

## Multi Selection

The `multiSelect` property enable users to select multiple non-consecutive dates. This is useful for scheduling events, selecting date ranges, or marking multiple important dates. 
 
<Preview 
  content={<MultiSelectionCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/multi-selection.tsx"
/>

## Disabled Calendar

The `disabled` property is used to disable the entire calendar component. This prevents all user interactions while maintaining the visual display of the calendar.
 
<Preview 
  content={<DisabledCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/disabled-calendar.tsx"
/>

## Readonly Calendar

The `readonly` property is used in the calendar component to prevent users from selecting or altering dates. This guarantees that the displayed information remains stable and unchanged.
 
<Preview 
  content={<ReadOnlyCalendar />} 
  path="calendar/readonly-calendar.tsx"
/>
