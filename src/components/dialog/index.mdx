# React Dialog

The `React Dialog` component is a pop-up window that appears in front of app content to show important information, collecting user input, showing forms, or presenting detailed content.

## Getting started

To create a new Vite project, refer to the <Link to="/getting-started/vite#set-up-the-vite-project">Vite</Link> documentation. Once that Vite project is ready to run with default settings, let's add the `React Dialog` component to the project.

### Installing SyncfusionÂ® packages

To use the `React Dialog` component in this project, the [`@syncfusion/react-popups`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/react-popups) package needs to be installed using the following command:

<Snippet content={dialogNpm}/>

### Adding CSS reference

In this article, the `Material 3` theme is applied using CSS styles, which are available in installed packages. The necessary Material CSS styles for the `Dialog` component and its dependents were imported into the `src/App.css` file.

<Snippet content={dialogStyles}/>

### Adding Dialog component

To include the `Dialog` component in your application, import the `Dialog` from the `@syncfusion/react-popups` package in `App.tsx`.

<Snippet content={dialogImport} />

Add the `Dialog` component in application as shown in below code example.

<Snippet content={dialogSnippet} />

### Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' }]} />

The following example demonstrates a basic `Dialog` with simple content and header. The dialog can be opened and closed using the [`open`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#open) property.

<Preview 
  content={<BasicDialog />} 
  path="dialog/basic-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Confirmation dialog

Confirmation dialog is a pop-up that appears before performing an important action, with buttons like "Yes/No" to confirm or cancel the action.

<Preview 
  content={<ConfirmationDialog />} 
  path="dialog/confirmation-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Alert dialog

Alert dialogs display important information that requires user acknowledgment. They usually contain a message and a single action button like "OK".

<Preview 
  content={<AlertDialog />} 
  path="dialog/alert-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Positioning

The `Dialog` component can be positioned at different locations on the screen using the [`position`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#position) property. This allows you to control where the dialog appears relative to the viewport.

<Preview 
  content={<PositionDialog />} 
  path="dialog/position-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Form dialog

Form dialogs contain interactive form elements and are commonly used for data entry, settings, or user input scenarios. They typically include form validation and submit/cancel actions.

<Preview 
  content={<FormDialog />} 
  path="dialog/form-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Full screen mode
 
The [`fullscreen`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#fullscreen) property allows the dialog to occupy the entire viewport, making it ideal for showing lots of complex contents or mobile interfaces where maximum screen is needed.
 
<Preview 
  content={<FullScreenDialog />} 
  path="dialog/fullscreen-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Non-modal dialog
 
The [`modal`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#modal) property determines whether the dialog is modal or non-modal. Non-modal dialogs allow users to interact with the background content while the dialog is open. This is useful for tool windows or information panels that don't require exclusive focus.
 
<Preview 
  content={<NonModalDialog />} 
  path="dialog/non-modal-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Action buttons
 
Dialogs can include custom action buttons in the footer area. These buttons typically handle user decisions like "Upload", "Cancel", etc.
 
<Preview 
  content={<ActionButtonsDialog />} 
  path="dialog/action-buttons-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Draggable dialog
 
The [`draggable`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#draggable) property allows the dialog to be moved around the screen by clicking and dragging the header area. This provides flexibility in positioning for better user experience.

<Preview 
  content={<DraggableDialog />} 
  path="dialog/draggable-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Resizable dialog
 
The [`resizable`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#resizable) property allows users to adjust the dialog size by dragging the edges or corners. This is particularly useful for dialogs contains different amounts of content that might need more or less space.

The [`resizeHandles`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#resizehandles) property controls which parts of the dialog can be dragged to resize it. You can specify individual directions like `South` (bottom edge), `East` (right edge), `NorthWest` (top-left corner), or use `All` to allow resizing from any edge or corner. This flexibility ensures that the dialog can be resized in a way that best suits the user's needs.
 
<Preview 
  content={<ResizableDialog />} 
  path="dialog/resizable-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Multiple dialogs
 
Multiple dialogs can be opened simultaneously with proper z-index management. This demonstrates how nested or layered dialogs behave in the application.
 
<Preview 
  content={<MultipleDialogs />} 
  path="dialog/multiple-dialogs.tsx"
/>

## Animation
 
The [`animation`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#animation) property allows you to specify custom animations for opening and closing the dialog. Custom animations can enhance the user experience and provide visual feedback.
 
<Preview 
  content={<AnimationDialog />} 
  path="dialog/animation-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Initial focus
 
The [`initialFocusRef`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#initialfocusref) property allows you to set the initial focus to a specific element when the dialog is opened. This improves accessibility and user experience by directing attention to the most relevant control. 
 
<Preview 
  content={<InitialFocusDialog />} 
  path="dialog/initial-focus-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Target 

The [`target`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/dialog/overview#target) property allows you to render the dialog within a specific HTML element instead of the default document body. This is useful for creating contained experiences where the dialog should be scoped to a particular area of the page.

<Preview 
  content={<TargetDialog />} 
  path="dialog/target-dialog.tsx"
/>

## Scrolling long content
 
When dialog content exceeds the available space, scrollbars are automatically added to maintain usability while keeping the dialog within viewport bounds.
 
<Preview 
  content={<ScrollingDialog />} 
  path="dialog/scrolling-dialog.tsx"
/>
 
## Accessibility
