# React TextBox

The `TextBox` component is a lightweight component that can be used to get input from users in various forms such as text, password, email, etc.

## Getting started

To create a new Vite project, refer to the <Link to="/getting-started/vite#set-up-the-vite-project">Vite</Link> documentation. documentation. Once that Vite project is ready to run with default settings, let’s add the `React TextBox` component to the project.

### Installing Syncfusion® packages

To use the `TextBox` component, install the [`@syncfusion/react-inputs`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/react-inputs) package:  

<Snippet content={TextBoxNpm}/>

### Adding CSS reference

The following CSS files are available in the Syncfusion® package that needs to be imported in the application.

<Snippet content={TextBoxStyles}/>

### Adding TextBox component

To include the `TextBox` component in your application, import the `TextBox` from the `@syncfusion/react-inputs` package in `App.tsx`.

<Snippet content={TextBoxImport}/>

Add the `TextBox` component in application as shown in below code example.

<Snippet content={TextBoxCode}/>

### Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' }]} />

The following example demonstrates the `TextBox` component is rendered with the given text.

<Preview content={<TextBoxBasic />} path="textbox/textbox.tsx" className="sb-padding-bottom-30" />

## Variants

The `TextBox` component enhances user interaction through its three distinct visual variants: `Standard`, `Outlined` and `Filled`.

<Preview
    content={<BasicTextBox />}
    path="textbox/basic.tsx"
/>

## Disabled

When the `disabled` attribute is set to true, the `TextBox` component cannot be edited or focused.

<Preview content={<Disabled />} path="textbox/disabled.tsx" />

## ReadOnly

When the `readOnly` attribute is set to true, the `TextBox` component cannot be edited.

<Preview content={<Readonly />} path="textbox/formprops.tsx" />

## Icons

The `TextBox` component allows for icon integration, with the ability to place icons at the start or end of the input using the [`prefix`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/textbox/overview#prefix) and [`suffix`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/textbox/overview#suffix) properties, respectively.

<Preview content={<Icons />} path="textbox/icons.tsx" />

## Sizes

The `TextBox` component enables you to set a more compact input by utilizing its [`size`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/textbox/overview#size) property.

<Preview content={<SizeSample />} path="textbox/size.tsx" />

## Controlled vs Uncontrolled

This component implements both controlled and uncontrolled state management paradigms, offering developers implementation flexibility:

* **Controlled**: External state management via parent props ensures centralized control, predictable data flow, and improved testability in complex interfaces.

* **Uncontrolled**: The component autonomously manages its internal state, minimizing boilerplate and simplifying standalone implementation with few external dependencies.

<Preview content={<Controlled />} path="textbox/controlled.tsx" />

## Customization

Use the styled-components library to customize the `TextBox` component's appearance. To prevent hierarchy conflicts, add extra class names. Here are some customization examples.

<Preview content={<Customization />} path="textbox/customization.tsx" />

## Adaptive rendering

The `TextBox` component implements context-sensitive rendering capabilities through its native type attribute.

<Preview content={<AdaptiveRendering />} path="textbox/adaptive-rendering.tsx" />

## Color

The `TextBox` component offers validation indicators `Success`, `Warning`, and `Error` through its [`color`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/textbox/overview#color) property.

<Preview content={<ValidationStates />} path="textbox/validation-states.tsx" />

## Float label

The floating label functionality offers three distinct behavioral modes: `Never`, `Auto` and `Always`.


<Preview content={<FloatLabel />} path="textbox/floatlabel.tsx" />

## Form support

The `TextBox` component integrates seamlessly with the form, as shown below.

<Preview content={<FormSample />} path="textbox/formsupport.tsx" />

## Accessibility

The `TextBox` component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.
