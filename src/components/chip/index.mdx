# React Chip

The `React Chip` component is a versatile, compact UI element that represents discrete information, attributes, or actions in an easily recognizable format. `Chip` can be customized with various styles, colors, and interactive elements like icons and avatars to enhance visual communication and user experience.

## Getting Started

To create a new Vite project, refer to the <Link to="/getting-started/vite?section=set-up-the-vite-project">Vite</Link> documentation. Once that Vite project is ready to run with default settings, let’s add the `React Chip` component to the project.

### Installing Syncfusion® packages

To use the `React Chip` component in this project, the [`@syncfusion/react-buttons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/react-buttons) package needs to be installed using the following command:

<Snippet content={chipNpm}/>

### Adding CSS reference

In this article, the `Material 3` theme is applied using CSS styles, which are available in installed packages. The necessary Material CSS styles for the `Chip` component and its dependents were imported into the `src/App.css` file.

<Snippet content={chipStyles}/>

### Adding Chip component

To include the `Chip` component in your application, import the `Chip` from the `@syncfusion/react-buttons` package in `App.tsx`.

<Snippet content={chipImport} />

Add the `Chip` component in application as shown in below code example.

<Snippet content={chipSnippet} />

### Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' }]} />

The following example demonstrates the basic implementation of the `Chip` component with default styling. These chips display discrete information in a compact, interactive format.

<Preview 
  content={<UsersChip />} 
  path="chip/basic-chip.tsx"
/>

## Removable chip

Removable chips include a delete icon that allows users to remove the chip. These are ideal the interface where users need to add or remove items dynamically. Click the delete icon to remove it from the collection. To create a removable chip, set the [`removable`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/chip/overview#removable) property to `true` and implement an [`onDelete`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/chip/overview#ondelete) event handler to manage the removal logic when the delete icon is clicked.

<Preview 
  content={<TreeChips />} 
  path="chip/removable-chip.tsx"
  reset={true}
/>

## Disabled chip

Disabled chips indicate non-interactive content that remains visible but cannot be selected or interacted with. These are useful for showing unavailable options while maintaining context for the user. To disable a chip, set the [`disabled`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/chip/overview#disabled) property to `true`. Disabled chips maintain their visual appearance but don't respond to user interactions.

<Preview 
  content={<CountryChips />} 
  path="chip/disabled-chip.tsx"
/>

## Customization

Chips can be customized in various ways to meet different design requirements and use cases. The following examples demonstrate different customization options including colors, outlines, avatars, and custom icons to enhance the visual appearance and functionality of chips.


### Colors

Color-coded chips use different background colors to visually categorize content or indicate different states. The [`color`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/chip/overview#color) property allows you to apply predefined theme colors (`primary`, `info`, `error`, `success`, and `warning`) to chips, helping users quickly distinguish between different items.

<Preview 
  content={<ColorChip />} 
  path="chip/color-chip.tsx"
/>

### Variants

Outlined chips have colored borders instead of filled backgrounds. They stand out less than filled chips but still use colors (in the border and text) to help users tell different items apart. This style creates a more refined look while maintaining visual differences through the colored outlines and text. To use filled mode for `Chip`, simply set the [`variant`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/chip/overview#variant) property to `filled`. To create outlined `Chip`, set the [`variant`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/chip/overview#variant) property to `outlined`. In this sample, the chips are displayed in `outlined` mode.

<Preview 
  content={<OutlineChip />} 
  path="chip/outline-chip.tsx"
/>

### Avatar and icons

Enhance your chips with visual elements like avatars, icons, and custom styling to improve recognition and user experience. This example demonstrates how to incorporate profile images for team members and a custom icon for the last chip, making information more identifiable at a glance. To add images to `Chip`, use the [`leadingIconUrl`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/chip/overview#leadingiconurl) property to specify the image path. For custom SVG icons, use the [`leadingIcon`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/chip/overview#leadingicon) property with JSX elements.

<Preview 
  content={<AvatarChip />} 
  path="chip/avatar-chip.tsx"
/>

### Template

Chips can be customized to display dynamic content. This example shows time zone chips that update in real-time, displaying current times for different regions around the world. The sample demonstrates how to create chips with custom content instead of simple text, and display live-updating information using `React` hooks.

<Preview 
  content={<TimeZoneChips />} 
  path="chip/template.tsx"
/>

## Accessibility

The `Chip` component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.

The accessibility compliance for the `Chip` component is outlined below.

| Accessibility Criteria | Compatibility |

<Check/> - All features of the component meet the requirement.

<Clock/> - Some features of the component do not meet the requirement.

<Cross/> - The component does not meet the requirement.

### WAI-ARIA attributes

The `Chip` component followed the [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/) patterns to meet the accessibility. The following ARIA attributes are used in the `Chip` component:

| Attributes | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| <mark>role=button</mark> | Used to convey a significant and contextual message to the user. |
| <mark>aria-label</mark> | Provides an accessible name for the `Chip`. |
| <mark>aria-disabled</mark> | Indicates element is perceivable but disabled. |


### Keyboard interaction

The `Chip` component followed the [keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/button/#keyboardinteraction) guideline, making it easy for people who use assistive technologies (AT) and those who completely rely on keyboard navigation. The following keyboard shortcuts are supported by the `Chip` component.

| **Windows** | **Mac** | **To do this** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <kbd>Delete , Backspace</kbd> | <kbd>Fn + delete , delete </kbd> |  Triggers the onDelete event. |
| <kbd>Enter , Space</kbd> | <kbd>Enter , Space</kbd>| Triggers the onClick event. |
