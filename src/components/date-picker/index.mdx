# React DatePicker

The React `DatePicker` component provides an intuitive interface for date selection and navigation. It offers a comprehensive set of features including multiple view modes, date range restrictions, custom rendering, and accessibility support for building robust date-picking experiences.

## Getting started

To create a new Vite project, refer to the <Link to="/getting-started/vite?section=set-up-the-vite-project">Vite</Link> documentation. Once that Vite project is ready to run with default settings, let's add the React `DatePicker` component to the project.

### Installing SyncfusionÂ® packages

To use the React `DatePicker` component in this project, the [`@syncfusion/react-calendars`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/react-calendars) package needs to be installed using the following command:

<Snippet content={datePickerNpm}/>

### Adding CSS reference

In this article, the `Material 3` theme is applied using CSS styles, which are available in installed packages. The necessary Material CSS styles for the `DatePicker` component and its dependents were imported into the **src/App.css** file.

<Snippet content={datePickerStyles}/>

### Adding Calendar component

To include the `DatePicker` component in your application, import the `DatePicker` from the `@syncfusion/react-calendars` package in **App.tsx**.

<Snippet content={datePickerImport} />

Add the `DatePicker` component in application as shown in below code example.

<Snippet content={datePickerSnippet} />

### Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' }]} />

The `DatePicker` component provides a simple and intuitive way to select dates. By default, it displays the current month and allows users to navigate between months and years.

<Preview 
  content={<BasicDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/basic-date-picker.tsx"
/>

## Views

The `DatePicker` component supports multiple view modes including Month, Year, and Decade. You can programmatically track which view is currently active using the `onViewChange` event handler.

The `DatePicker` starts with the Month view by default and allows users to drill up to Year and Decade views or back down to more specific selections. The example below demonstrates how to detect and display the current view mode:

The `DatePicker` supports the following view types:
- **Month view**: Displays days of a month, allowing selection of a specific date
- **Year view**: Displays months of a year, letting users choose a month
- **Decade view**: Displays years of a decade, enabling selection of a specific year

<Preview 
  content={<ViewDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/view-date-picker.tsx"
/>

## Controlled Vs Uncontrolled

The `DatePicker` component can be used in both controlled and uncontrolled modes. In controlled mode, the component's value is managed by the parent component, while in uncontrolled mode, the component manages its own state.

<Preview 
  content={<ControlledDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/controlled-date-picker.tsx"
/>

## Disabled Dates

The `DatePicker` component allows you to disable specific dates, preventing users from selecting them. This is useful for blocking out holidays, weekends, or any dates that should not be selectable in your application.

You can disable dates in the `DatePicker` using the `cellTemplate` prop, which lets you customize how individual date cells are rendered. In the example below, we've disabled the 4th, 15th, and 25th days of each month by applying the `sf-disabled` CSS class:

<Preview 
  content={<DisabledDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/disable-date-picker.tsx"
/>

## Special Dates 

The `DatePicker` is used to customize the appearance of specific dates by highlighting important dates, events, or special occasions with custom styling, icons, or indicators.

<Preview 
  content={<SpecialDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/special-date-picker.tsx"
/>

## Month picker

Configure the `DatePicker` to function as a month picker by setting the appropriate start and depth properties. This mode allows users to select entire months rather than specific dates, perfect for monthly reports or billing cycles.

<Preview 
  content={<MonthDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/month-date-picker.tsx"
/>

## Format

The `DatePicker` component supports various date formats, allowing you to display and receive date values in formats that best suit your application needs. You can specify custom date formats using the `format` property, which accepts standard date format patterns.

<Preview 
  content={<FormatDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/format-date-picker.tsx"
/>

## Appearance

### Disabled

The `DatePicker` component can be disabled to prevent user interaction. This is useful when you want to temporarily disable the date selection functionality, such as during form validation or when certain conditions are not met. You can disable the `DatePicker` by setting the `disabled` property to `true`.
<Preview 
  content={<DisableDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/disabled-date-picker.tsx"
/>

### ReadOnly

The `DatePicker` component can be set to read-only mode, which allows users to view the selected date but prevents them from making any changes. This is useful when you want to display a date value that should not be altered by the user, such as in a read-only form or when the date is determined by another process. You can set the `DatePicker` to read-only mode by setting the `readOnly` property to `true`.

<Preview 
  content={<ReadOnlyDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/readOnly-date-picker.tsx"
/>

## Forms support

The `DatePicker` component can be integrated into forms to allow users to select dates as part of form submissions. This integration ensures that the selected date is included in the form data, making it easy to handle and validate user input. You can use the `DatePicker` component within a form by placing it inside a `<form>` element and handling the form submission as needed.

<Preview 
  content={<FormSupportDatePicker />} 
  path="date-picker/form-support-date-picker.tsx"
/>
