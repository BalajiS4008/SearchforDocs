# React Toast

The `Toast` component offers a seamless way to notify users without disrupting their workflow, appearing briefly before disappearing automatically.

## Getting started

To create a new Vite project, refer to the <Link to="/getting-started/vite#set-up-the-vite-project">Vite</Link> documentation. Once that Vite project is ready to run with default settings, let’s add the `React Toast` component to the project.

### Installing Syncfusion® packages

To use the Toast component, install the [`@syncfusion/react-notifications`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/react-notifications) package:  

<Snippet content={ToastNpm}/>

### Adding CSS reference

Import the `Toast` component’s required CSS references as follows in `src/App.css`.

<Snippet content={ToastStyles}/>

### Adding Toast component

To include the `Toast` component in your application, import the `Toast` from `@syncfusion/react-notifications` package in `App.tsx`.

<Snippet content={ToastImport}/>

Add the `Toast` component in application as shown in below code example.

<Snippet content={ToastCode} />

### Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' }]} />

This demonstration showcases a `Toast` component that is triggered by a toggle button through the use of the [`open`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/toast/overview#open) property when clicked. Additionally, the toast's progress bar is displayed by setting the [`progressBar`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/toast/overview#progressbar) property to `true`.

<Preview content={<DirectUsageWrapper />} path="toast/default.tsx" />

## Types

The `Toast` component offers a complete range of predefined notification types that effectively convey messages to users both visually and semantically: `Success`, `Error`, `Warning`, and `Info`.

<Preview content={<ToastUtilityWrapper />} path="toast/varients.tsx" />

## Action Toast

The `actionToast` sample demonstrates how to add interactive buttons to a Toast notification using the [`actions`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/toast/overview#actions) property. This allows you to create confirmation dialogs that prompt users for a response, such as 'Undo' or 'Confirm', and execute specific logic based on their choice.

<Preview content={<ActionToast/>} path="toast/actionToast.tsx" />

## Multiple

The `Multiple` sample demonstrates how to dynamically update multiple notifications to reflect the real-time status of a task, like a file upload.

<Preview content={<Multiple/>} path="toast/multiple.tsx" />

## Toast placement

The `Toast` component provides versatile positioning options for notifications, including corner positions (Left-Top, Right-Top, Left-Bottom, Right-Bottom) and centered positions (Center-Top, Center-Bottom) to enhance your application's layout and user experience.

<Preview content={<Types />} path="toast/types.tsx" />

## Templates

The `Toast` component supports custom content templates and offers a variety of animation effects to create a more engaging user experience.

<Preview content={<ToastApi />} path="toast/apisample.tsx" />
