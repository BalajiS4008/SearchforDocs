# React Skeleton

The `Skeleton` component enhances user engagement by improving loading states during data retrieval.

## Getting started

To create a new Vite project, refer to the <Link to="/getting-started/vite#set-up-the-vite-project">Vite</Link> documentation. Once that Vite project is ready to run with default settings, let’s add the `React Skeleton` component to the project.

### Installing Syncfusion® packages

To use the `Skeleton` component, install the [`@syncfusion/react-notifications`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/react-notifications) package:  

<Snippet content={SkeletonNpm}/>

### Adding CSS reference

Import the `Skeleton` component’s required CSS references as follows in `src/App.css`.

<Snippet content={SkeletonStyles}/>

### Adding Skeleton component

To include the `Skeleton` component in your application import the `Skeleton` from `@syncfusion/react-notifications` package in `App.tsx`.

<Snippet content={SkeletonImport}/>

Add the `Skeleton` component in application as shown in below code example.

<Snippet content={SkeletonCode}/>

### Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' }]} />

The following example demonstrates the `Skeleton` component is rendered with the given shape.

<Preview content={<SkeletonDefault />} path="skeleton/default.tsx" />

## Variants

The `Skeleton` component provides `Text`, `Circular`, `Rectangular`, and `Square` variants for consistent loading UI design via the [`variant`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/skeleton/overview#variant) property.

<Preview content={<SkeletonVarients />} path="skeleton/vaients.tsx" scroll={false}/>

## Animations

Enhance loading with the `Skeleton` component's animations: `Wave`, `Pulse`, `Fade`, or `None` via the [`animation`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/skeleton/overview#animation) property.

### Pulse

The `Pulse` animation creates a subtle rhythmic effect, ideal for emphasizing loading elements in dashboards and data-rich interfaces.

<Preview content={<PulseEffect />} path="skeleton/pulseeffect.tsx" />

### Fade

The `Fade` animation offers smooth opacity transitions, making it a minimalist loading indicator perfect for professional, content-focused interfaces.

<Preview content={<FadeEffect />} path="skeleton/fadeeffect.tsx" />

### Wave

The `Wave` animation smoothly indicates active loading in interactive apps and media-rich environments.

<Preview content={<WaveEffect />} path="skeleton/waveeffect.tsx" />

## Transitions

The `Skeleton` component enhances loading experiences, ensuring visual consistency in dynamic applications with frequent content updates. This approach fosters responsive interfaces during complex data operations.

<Preview content={<DynamicContent />} path="skeleton/dynamiccontent.tsx" />

## Color

You can customize the component’s color by adjusting its background-color CSS property.

<Preview content={<Color />} path="skeleton/color.tsx" />

## Accessibility

The `Skeleton` component followed the accessibility guidelines and standards, including [ADA](https://www.ada.gov/), [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/), [WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards, and [WCAG roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/#roles) that are commonly used to evaluate accessibility.
