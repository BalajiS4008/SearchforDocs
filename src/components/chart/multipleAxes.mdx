# Multiple Axis in React Chart

In addition to the primary X and Y axes, you can add multiple additional axes to a chart using the [`ChartAxes`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/chart/chartaxisprops) component. This is useful when displaying data series with different scales or units.
Each axis should have a unique name, and you can associate a data series with a specific axis by mapping it to that name.
