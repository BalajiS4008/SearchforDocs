# React Combination Chart

A combination chart allows you to display different types of data series—such as columns, lines within a single chart. This is especially useful when comparing related metrics that benefit from distinct visual representations.

For example:
- Use columns to show sales volume
- Use a line to show profit margin

## Combination chart with multiple axes

When the metrics have different units or scales (e.g., dollars vs. percentages), plotting them on the same axis can distort the visualization. That’s where multiple axes come in.
You can add additional Y axes (or even X axes) to the chart and map each series to its corresponding axis using a unique name.
