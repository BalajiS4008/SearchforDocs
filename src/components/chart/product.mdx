# Cloud Monitoring Dashboard with React Chart
This Cloud Monitoring Dashboard is built using a React chart component that dynamically renders live data. It offers interactive features such as tooltips, zooming, and a legend to enhance user experience and facilitate deeper data exploration.
The chart supports multiple visualization types including line, bar, and area charts to represent key cloud metrics such as:
- CPU usage
- Memory consumption
- Network latency
- Service uptime

This dashboard enables users to monitor cloud infrastructure in real time, helping identify performance trends and potential issues with ease.
