# Events in React Chart

An event is an action or occurrence detected by the Chart, such as clicks or mouse movements. Events enable interactivity, allowing users to respond to changes and interact with data.

## Mouse event

This event setup defines multiple callbacks for user interactions with the chart, including mouse movements, clicks on data points or axis labels, legend clicks, improving interactivity and data presentation.
