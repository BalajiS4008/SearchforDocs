# Selection in React Data Grid
 
The Syncfusion® React Data Grid supports a built-in selection feature that allows interactive highlighting of single or multiple rows. This feature is useful for performing data operations, highlighting specific rows, or executing custom actions within the grid


## Selection mode
The Data Grid component manages row selection behavior through the [`selectionSettings.mode`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/data-grid/selectionsettings#mode) property. This property defines whether single or multiple rows can be selected. The supported selection modes are:

### Single row selection

The default value for `selectionSettings.mode` is `Single`. In this mode, only one row can be selected at a time by clicking it or pressing <kbd>Space</kbd> key on the focused row.

### Multiple row selection

Set `selectionSettings.mode` to `Multiple` to enable selecting more than one row. This mode supports selection in two ways:

- Multiple rows: Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> (on <kbd>⌘</kbd> macOS) key while clicking each row to include in the selection.

- Range of rows: Click any row to select it, then hold the <kbd>Shift</kbd> key and click another row to select all rows between them.

>  Toggle selection is disabled by default, do not allowing a row to be selected or deselected by clicking the same row.

## Prevent selection using property
 
To disable row selection, set [`selectionSettings.enabled`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/data-grid/selectionsettings#enabled) to `false`. This disables all selection interactions and related events, effectively turning off row selection functionality within the grid.

## Customizing selection and hover styles

To customize the default style of selected rows, modify the styles in the `.sf-grid .sf-active` CSS class. To change the appearance of rows when hovered over, apply styles to `.sf-grid-content-row:hover .sf-cell`. The example below shows how the background colors for both selected and hovered rows can be modified.

## Programmatic selection

Row selection can be managed programmatically with the following methods:

- [`selectRow(index)`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/data-grid/overview#selectrow): Selects a single row at the specified index.

- [`selectRows([indices])`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/data-grid/overview#selectrows): Selects multiple rows by providing an array of indices. Ensure that `selectionSettings.mode` is set to `Multiple` in the grid configuration to enable selecting more than one row.

- [`clearRowSelection([indices])`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/data-grid/overview#clearrowselection): Removes selection only from the specified rows, without affecting other selected rows.

- [`clearSelection()`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/data-grid/overview#clearselection): Clears all selected rows.

## Toggle selection

The Data Grid component includes the toggle selection feature, which is disabled by default. Clicking an unselected row selects it, while clicking a selected row should not deselects it. This behavior applies to both single and multiple selection modes.

To enable toggle selection, set [`selectionSettings.enableToggle`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/data-grid/selectionsettings#enabletoggle) to `true`. When enabled, selection behaves as follows:

### Single selection mode

- Clicking a selected row again deselects it.
- Selecting a different row by clicking or using the `selectRow` method clears the previous selection and selects the new row.

### Multiple selection mode

- Clicking a selected row without holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key clears other row selections and retains only the clicked row.
- Clicking the same row again with holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key removes its selection, resulting in no selected rows.
- Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key allows modifying the selection without clearing other rows.
- Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> selects a range of rows between the last focused row and the clicked row.

> On macOS, use the <kbd>⌘</kbd> key in place of the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.

## Events
 
The Data Grid component provides event hooks for selection changes:

| Event | Description |
|---|---|
| [`onRowSelect`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/data-grid/overview#onrowselect) | Fires after a row is selected. Provides details for post-selection actions such as highlighting, loading related data, or updating UI elements. |
| [`onRowDeselect`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/data-grid/overview#onrowdeselect) | Fires after a row is deselected. Provides details for actions such as clearing data, resetting UI states, or logging deselection events. |
