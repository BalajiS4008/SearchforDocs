# React Floating Action Button

The Floating Action Button ([`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview)) enhances accessibility with its floating design and customizable icons and colors for context.

## Getting started

To create a new Vite project, refer to the <Link to="/getting-started/vite#set-up-the-vite-project">Vite</Link> documentation. Once that Vite project is ready to run with default settings, let’s add the React [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) component to the project.

### Installing Syncfusion® packages

To use the [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) component, install the [`@syncfusion/react-buttons`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@syncfusion/react-buttons) package:  

<Snippet content={fabNpm}/>

### Adding CSS reference

Import the [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) component’s required CSS references as follows in **src/App.css**.

<Snippet content={fabStyles}/>

### Adding FAB component

To include the [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) component in your application, import the `FAB` from `@syncfusion/react-buttons` package in **App.tsx**.

<Snippet content={fabImport}/>

Add the [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) component in application as shown in below code example.

<Snippet content={fabComponent}/>

### Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "npm", code: 'npm run dev' }]} />

The following example demonstrates how to render a simple [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) component.

<Preview content={<Default />} path="floating-action-button/default.tsx" />

## Color

The [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) component provides various styles to convey different alert levels, including `Warning`, `Success`, `Error`, and `Info`, through its [`color`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview#color) property.

<Preview
  content={<ColorSample />}
  path="floating-action-button/color.tsx"
/>

## Icon and text

The [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) component lets you customize the button's appearance by including an icon, a text label, or both.

<Preview
  content={<Content />}
  path="floating-action-button/content.tsx"
/>

## Size

The [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) component can be resized for design flexibility, allowing it to fit into limited spaces while maintaining its core functionality.

<Preview
  content={<SizeSample />}
  path="floating-action-button/size.tsx"
/>

## Position

The [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) can be placed anywhere in the UI, allowing developers to optimize its position for user impact and experience through testing.

<Preview
  content={<Position />}
  path="floating-action-button/position.tsx"
/>

## Disabled

Disabling the [`FAB`](https://react-api.syncfusion.com/floating-action-button/overview) signals temporary unavailability, guiding users to refrain from interaction until it’s functional again. When the `disabled` attribute is set, the button cannot change its state.

<Preview
  content={<Disabled />}
  path="floating-action-button/disabled.tsx"
/>
