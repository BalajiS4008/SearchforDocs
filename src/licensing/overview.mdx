# Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> Licensing Overview

We have introduced license key validation for Essential Studio<sup>®</sup> React components. This licensing key validation will enforce the developer to register the valid licensing key in an application while referring to any of the latest React packages from `npm`.

Before using any React components, you must register the license key in the application code. Otherwise you will get license validation error message in application as shown in below

> This application was built using a trial version of Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> Essential Studio. Please include a valid license to permanently remove this license validation message. You can also obtain a free 30 day evaluation license to temporarily remove this message during the evaluation period.

## Difference between Unlock Key and License Key

Please note that this license key is different from the installer unlock key you may have used previously and must be generated separately on the Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> website.

* `Unlock Key` - Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> Unlock Key is used to unlock the Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> installers alone.

* `License Key` - Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> License Key is a string that needs to be registered in your script to avoid licensing warning.
