# Right-to-Left support in React Components

Right-to-Left (RTL) support enables applications to communicate effectively with users who read languages from right to left, such as `Arabic` and `Hebrew`.

Syncfusion<sup>Â®</sup> React UI components can render content in RTL by setting the `dir` property to `rtl` in the `Provider` context. This action adds the class name `sf-rtl` to the component element, aligning our React components in the right-to-left direction.

## Enable RTL for individual components

To enable Right-to-Left (RTL) support for an individual component, set the `dir` property to `rtl` in the `Provider` context.

The following example demonstrates how to configure the `Provider` with `dir={'rtl'}` to align the `Grid` component's content in a right-to-left layout:

<Preview 
  content={<RTL />} 
  path="common-features/rtl.tsx"
/>
