## Search UI Analysis & Implementation

Refer to the Material UI documentation and analyze the Search UI in terms of its appearance, flow, and functionality.
The Search component is located at the top-right corner of the page:
üîó MUI Supported Components -  https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/supported-components/

Begin by analyzing the /App.tsx file to understand the component structure and data flow.
While implementing a similar Search UI appearance and behavior, use Syncfusion Pure React components instead of Material UI components.

For example:

If the UI includes a Button, use the Syncfusion Pure React Button as shown here:
üîó Syncfusion Button Example - https://react.syncfusion.com/button#icon-and-label

Follow this approach for other UI components as well to ensure consistency with the Pure React implementation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Search Functionality Implementation ‚Äî Do‚Äôs and Don‚Äôts**

### ‚úÖ **Do‚Äôs**

1. **Follow the MUI reference flow:**

   * Analyze the [MUI Supported Components](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/supported-components/) page for **Search UI behavior and placement**.
   * Understand the appearance and interaction pattern before starting implementation.

2. **Use Syncfusion Pure React Components:**

   * Replace all MUI components with **Syncfusion Pure React equivalents**.
   * Example: for buttons, use [Syncfusion Button](https://react.syncfusion.com/button#icon-and-label).
   * Maintain consistent styling and behavior across components (Button, Dialog, Input, etc.).

3. **Implement the Search Component Cleanly:**

   * Create a dedicated component named **`Search`** for logic and UI separation.
   * Keep the topbar Search button in `App.tsx` and open a **Syncfusion Dialog** for the search interface.
   * Use **controlled components** for input handling.

4. **Ensure Live Search Functionality:**

   * Trigger the search operation on **each keystroke** (real-time updates).
   * Match search queries with **titles and subheadings** dynamically.
   * Display results directly below the input inside the dialog.

5. **Focus on Performance Optimization:**

   * Debounce input events to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
   * Use **memoization** (`React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`) for stable renders.
   * Avoid redundant state updates.

6. **Maintain Clean and Readable Code:**

   * Follow component-based structure.
   * Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and components.
   * Add brief inline comments for complex logic or edge case handling.

7. **Handle Edge Cases Gracefully:**

   * Empty input ‚Üí show no results or ‚ÄúNo results found‚Äù message.
   * Case-insensitive search.
   * Trim leading/trailing spaces from user input.

### ‚ùå **Don‚Äôts**

1. **Don‚Äôt use Material UI or third-party paid plugins** (like Algolia DocSearch).

   * All components must come from **Syncfusion Pure React**.

2. **Don‚Äôt hardcode data or static results.**

   * The search should dynamically match documentation data (titles, subtitles, or relevant JSON content).

3. **Don‚Äôt block UI updates.**

   * Avoid synchronous loops or heavy computations during search filtering.

4. **Don‚Äôt duplicate logic** inside `App.tsx`.

   * Keep all search logic within the `Search` component for reusability and maintainability.

5. **Don‚Äôt forget responsiveness.**

   * Ensure the search dialog and results adapt properly to different screen sizes.

6. **Don‚Äôt skip accessibility and usability basics.**

   * Add proper ARIA labels for inputs and buttons.
   * Maintain keyboard navigation and focus control inside the dialog.


 # Goals:

 Implement the Search UI appearance in ./App.tsx (topbar) using Syncfusion Pure React components.
Create a dedicated Search component named Search that manages both the UI and search functionality.

## Expected UI Flow

1. The Search button should appear on the topbar, aligned to the right side.

2. On clicking the Search button, a Syncfusion Pure React Dialog should open.

3. Inside this dialog:

4. Render a Search Input component.

5. The input should perform a live search operation on titles and subheadings.

Example: typing "button" should display all results where the word ‚Äúbutton‚Äù appears in the title or subheadings.

6. Display the search results dynamically below the input field, updating with each keystroke.

üîó Reference: Syncfusion Button Example - https://react.syncfusion.com/button#icon-and-label

 Now we need implement that Search UI appearance on './App.tsx' in topbar using Syncfusion Pure React component, and should create the search functionality in search component and name is Search.
