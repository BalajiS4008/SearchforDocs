# Getting Started with a Preact App using React Components

This guide walks you through setting up a [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) project and integrating the Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components.

`Preact` is a fast and lightweight `JavaScript` library for building user interfaces. It's often used as an alternative to larger frameworks like React. The key difference is that `Preact` is designed to be smaller in size and faster in performance, making it a good choice for projects where file size and load times are critical factors. 

## Prerequisites

## Set up the Preact project

To create a new `Preact` project, use either an NPM or Yarn command:

<Snippet content={preactNpm} />

Using one of the above commands will prompt you to configure the project as follows:

1\. Define the project name: Specify the name of the project directly. For this guide, let's name the project `my-project`.

<Snippet content={preactProjectSnippet} />


2\. Choose `TypeScript` as the framework variant to build this `Preact` project using `Typescript` and `React`.

<Snippet content={preactcodePreferenceSnippet} />

3\. Then configure the project as below for this guide.

<Snippet content={preactOtherPreferenceSnippet} />


4\. After completing the above steps to create `my-project`, run the following command to navigate into the project directory:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "CMD", code: 'cd my-project' }]} />


Now that `my-project` is ready to run with default settings, let's add Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React component to the project.

## Add Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React packages

To use Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React `Chip` components in the project, install the corresponding npm package. This guide uses the React <Link to="/chip">`Chip`</Link> component as an example. To use the React `Chip` component in the project, the `@syncfusion/react-buttons` package needs to be installed using the following command:

<Snippet content={chipPackage} />

## Import Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> CSS styles

Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components are styled using <Link to="/appearance/built-in-themes">built-in themes</Link>. The necessary `Material 3` CSS styles for the `Chip` component and its dependents were imported into the `src/style.css` file.

<Snippet content={preactStyles} />

## Add Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React component

Follow the steps below to add the React Chip component to your project:

1\. Before adding the `Chip` component to your markup, import the `Chip` component in the `src/index.tsx` file.

<Snippet content={[{ title: "index.tsx", code: `import { Chip } from '@syncfusion/react-buttons';` }]} />


2\. Next, add the `Chip` component in the application using the following code sample.


<Snippet content={preactChipSample} />

## Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={runSample} />

The output will appear as follows:

<Preview content={<AvatarChip />} header={false} />
