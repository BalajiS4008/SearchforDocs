# Getting Started with a Gatsby App using React Components

This guide walks you through setting up a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) project and integrating the Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components.

`Gatsby` is an open-source framework built on React that enables developers to create fast, modern websites and web applications. It combines the best features of `React`, `GraphQL`, and modern `JavaScript` to build a fast and scalable website.

## Prerequisites

## Set up the Gatsby project

1\. To create a new `Gatsby` project, use one of the commands that are specific to either NPM or Yarn.

<Snippet content={gatsbyNpm} />

2\. Using one of the above commands will lead you to set up additional configurations for the project, as below:

Define the project name: We can specify the name of the project directly. Let's specify the name of the project as `my-project` for this guide.

<Snippet content={gatsbyPreferenceSnippet} />

3\. Upon completing the aforementioned steps to create `my-project`, run the following command to jump into the project directory:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "CMD", code: 'cd my-project' }]} />

Now that `my-project` is ready to run with default settings, let's add Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React component to the project.

## Add Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React packages

This guide uses the React <Link to="/floating-action-button">`FAB`</Link> component as an example. To use the React `FAB` component in the project, the `@syncfusion/react-buttons` package needs to be installed using the following command:

<Snippet content={fabBtnPackage} />

## Import Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> CSS styles

Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components are styled using <Link to="/appearance/built-in-themes">built-in themes</Link>. The necessary `Material 3` CSS styles for the `FAB` component and its dependents were imported into the `src/pages/style.css` file.

<Snippet content={gatsbyStyles} />

## Add Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React component

Follow the below steps to add the React `FAB` component to the project:

1\. Before adding the `FAB` component to your markup, import the `FAB` component in the `src/pages/index.tsx` file.

<Snippet content={[{ title: "index.tsx", code: `import { Fab } from "@syncfusion/react-buttons";` }]} />

2\. Then, add the `FAB` component in the application using the following code sample.
.

<Snippet content={gatsbyFABSample} />

## Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={gatsbyRunSample} />

The output will appear as follows:

<Preview content={<FloatingActionButton />} header={false} />
