# Getting Started with an Astro App using React Components

This guide shows you how to set up an `Astro` application and integrating Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components.

## What is Astro?

`Astro` is a modern web framework for building fast, content-driven sites. It focuses on performance and is ideal for static websites, blogs, and documentation. Developers use `Astro` to create lightweight, highly optimized projects with ease.

## Prerequisites

* <p><a href="https://docs.astro.build/en/install-and-setup/#prerequisites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">System requirements for Astro Application</a></p>

## Create an Astro project

To create a new `Astro` project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "CMD", code: 'npm create astro@latest' }]} />

After running the command, follow the prompts to configure your `Astro` project:

<Snippet content={astroProjectConfig} />

## Add React support to Astro project

React is one of the most popular UI libraries that can be seamlessly integrated with `Astro` projects. Follow these steps to add React support to your `Astro` project.

1\. Install React and `Astro` React packages

Install the necessary React packages and the `Astro` React packages:

<Snippet content={[{ title: "CMD", code: 'npm i react react-dom @astrojs/react' }]} />

2\. Integrate React with `Astro`

Open your `astro.config.mjs` file and add the React integration code:

<Snippet content={astroConfig} />

## Install Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React packages

Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components are available on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react). To integrate them into your project, install the required npm package.

To use the React `Message` component, install the `@syncfusion/react-notifications` package:

<Snippet content={[ { title: "CMD", code: `npm install @syncfusion/react-notifications --save` } ]} />

## Add the Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React component

To use the `Message` component in your application, create a new file named `message.tsx` in the `src/components/` directory. Then, add the following sample code to include the `Message` in your `Astro` project.

<Snippet content={astroMsgSnippet} />

## Import Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> CSS styles

Import themes for our React components using CSS or SASS from npm packages. For details on built-in themes and usage, refer to the <Link to="/appearance/built-in-themes">themes topic</Link>.

In this guide, we apply the `Material3` theme with CSS styles in the `src/components/message.tsx` file:

<Snippet content={astroStyles} />

> Ensure CSS styles are imported in the correct dependency order.

## Display the message component in the Astro page

To show the `Message` component on your page, import and place it in your `src/pages/index.astro` file:

<Snippet content={astroIndexSnippet} />

> Use `client:only="react"` for Syncfusion<sup>®</sup> React components because these components depend entirely on React’s runtime and cannot be server-rendered by `Astro`.

## Run the project

To run the project, use the following command:

<Snippet content={runSample} />

The output will appear as follows:

<Preview content={<DefaultMessage />} header={false} />
